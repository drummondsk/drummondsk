I am a computer science major and a business administration minor at Berea College, where I have excelled academically and professionally, receiving multiple honors and awards for my academic performance and leadership skills. I am passionate about solving complex problems, creating a positive impact, and developing my career as a software developer.

As an EMIT intern at ExxonMobil, I apply my skills and knowledge in software and web development, user experience research, technical support, and test automation to create innovative and efficient solutions for the energy industry. 

I am also an MLT Career Prep Fellow, an IBM Accelerate Program Participant, and a Bloomberg Accelerator Summer School Participant, where I have gained valuable insights and exposure to the technical interview process, the engineering culture, and the latest trends and technologies in the industry.
